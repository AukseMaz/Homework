The following bugs have been found in the ToDo management application:

    1. The headline text contains a grammatical error where 'To Do List' should be corrected to 'To-Do List' 

    2. The input placeholder text contains a grammatical error where 'need's' should be corrected to 'needs'

    3. The text at the very bottom of the application contains a grammatical error; 'toodo' should be corrected to 'To-Do.'

    4. The result of the calculation related to a specific to-do item is off by one unit, indicating that the calculated value is one less than what it should be. 

    5. When the 'drop down menu'-like button is clicked, it appears blurry to indicate that it is inactive, while all items on the to-do list are marked as completed by placing a tick in the circle next to each item and crossing out each completed item. 

        5.1. The 'All' button is designed to perform the same function as the 'drop down menu' button.

        5.2. The action of marking an item as completed by placing a tick in the circle next to each item is unnecessary, as there is already a button 'Completed' available to perform this action. 

            5.2.1. The 'Completed' button does not mark items as completed. Instead, clicking this button hides (not deletes) the entire list of items.

            5.2.2. The calculation of items remains visible but is inaccurate, being off by one unit.

        5.3. The action of crossing out each completed item is unnecessary since there is already a button available to remove items.

        5.4. Overall, the 'drop down menu' button is unnecessary in the input placeholder.

    6. The button 'active' performs similarly to the button 'All'. 

        6.1. For consistency, the text of the button 'active' should be corrected to 'Active'

    7. When placing a tick in the circle next to the completed item, it is cleared from the list immediately
